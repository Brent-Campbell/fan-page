            <h2>Minnesota Vikings Football Team</h2>
            <p>The Minnesota Vikings are my favorite professional football team. I enjoy watching professional football on a weekly basis during the football season however, I really enjoy watching the Vikings games. I am really happy that they hired Head Coach Mike Zimmer two years ago and believe he is the right man for the job. If he can continue to get the type of players he wants to get for this defense they can be a top 10 defense for years to come. I think the offense needs to improve some but I believe they are getting better and should improve as Teddy Bridgwater gains experience. Overall I believe they are headed in the right direction and look forward to the continued growth and success of my favorite football team.</p>

            <h2>My Favorite Vikings Players</h2>
            <p>I like the Vikings roster as a whole but there are a few players that I would consider to be my favorites. My favorite Vikings players list currently consists of these players:</p>

            <h2>New Vikings Stadium</h2>
            <p>The Minnesota Vikings are currently building a new stadium to be the their future home. It is currently set to open in time for the 2016 season. I am really looking forward to watching them play their inaugural season in their new stadium next year. I have been keeping up with the construction progress of the new stadium over the past year and a half and am really excited to see the finished product. I believe the new stadium will be one of the nicest and unique stadiums in the league when it is completed. The ammenities in the stadium are going to second to none from what I have heard.</p>
